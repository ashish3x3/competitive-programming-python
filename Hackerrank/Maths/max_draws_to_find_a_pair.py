Input Format 
The first line contains the number of test cases T. 
Next T lines contains an integer N which indicates the total pairs of socks present in the drawer.

Output Format 
Print the number of Draws (x) Jim makes in the worst case scenario.

Sample Output

2
3
Explanation 
Case 1 : A pair of socks are present, hence exactly 2 draws for the socks to match. 
Case 2 : 2 pair of socks are present in the drawer. The first and the second draw might result in 2 socks of different color. The 3rd sock picked will definitely match one of previously picked socks. Hence, 3.
